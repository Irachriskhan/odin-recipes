        <p>African food is just as diverse as the continent itself. Origins began 
            from locally grown crops in Africa. With time, we have seen many 
            popular African foods now becoming very popular around the world. <br><br>
            Africans are known for the exotic spices used in their foods. 
            They're used in many traditional dishes, creating flavors tasted 
            only in Africa. From vegetables to meats and other dishes, spices are 
            used for almost everything. Many of the traditional spices used are 
            natively found in Africa. These have since been exported and used 
            around the world. Some people like the addition of spices as a way 
            to add flavor, spice, or even just decoration to improve the 
            presentation.</p>
