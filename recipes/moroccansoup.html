            <h3>Steps for making Moroccan Harira Soup</h3>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li><br>
                    <li>Heat olive oil in a stock pot over medium-high heat and cook cubed lamb 
                        until nicely browned and some of the fat has rendered, about 5 minutes.</li><br>
                    <li>Toss in diced onion and a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring often, 
                        until onion is soft and lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Season with 
                        smoked paprika, coriander, cumin, ground ginger, black pepper, and 
                        cinnamon. Add minced garlic and cook and stir until fragrant, 30 seconds 
                        to 1 minute.</li><br>
                    <li>Add tomato paste and cook and stir for about 1 minute.</li><br>
                    <li>Add chicken broth, crushed tomatoes, and celery; stir until well 
                        combined. Add water and bring to a boil over high heat.</li><br>
                    <li>Once soup is boiling, add chickpeas and green lentils; season 
                        with salt to taste. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 30 
                        minutes, stirring occasionally.</li><br>
                    <li>Mix flour and 2 tablespoons cold water in a small bowl and drizzle 
                        slurry into the soup to thicken.</li><br>
                    <li>Bring back to a simmer and add 1/2 of the cilantro and 1/2 of the 
                        parsley; stir to combine.</li><br>
                    <li>Simmer on medium-low heat until meat and lentils are perfectly 
                        tender and soup has thickened, about 20 more minutes.</li><br>
                    <li>Stir in vermicelli and cook until tender, 10 to 15 minutes. 
                        Taste and adjust seasoning with cayenne and salt. Add remaining 
                        chopped cilantro and parsley and finish by drizzling lemon juice 
                        to taste into the soup.</li><br>
                    <li>Serve immediately with a drizzle of olive oil.</li>
